To scale up your streaming plaform to million of users and make it available through a truly powerful and decentralized CDN, you can register your Media Server instance as a new CDN resource. This is done through the [Media App](https://app.media.network), a front-end developed by the Media Foundation to interact with Media Network enabling developers to set up and configure CDN resources.

#### Add a new CDN Resource

#### Change your RTMP ingest URL and CDN URL 

After the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, a new random subdomain will be assigned to you. This is your new endpoint URL cached by Media Network.

Edit the config file of your Media Server adding this newly generated endpoint. You can also change your ingest RTMP server details here.

```bash
nano config.js
```

```js title="mediaserver/config.js"
const config = {
//...
  cdn_url: "https://Resource_ID.medianetwork.cloud",
  rtmp_url: "rtmp://YOUR.IP.ADDRESS",
//...
```

And then run the Media Server again to apply the changes:

```bash
node app.js
```
