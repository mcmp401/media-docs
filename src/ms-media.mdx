To scale up your streaming plaform to million of users and make it available through a truly powerful and decentralized CDN, you can register your Media Server instance as a new CDN resource. This is done through the [Media App](https://app.media.network), a front-end developed by the Media Foundation to interact with Media Network enabling developers to set up and configure CDN resources.

### Pre-requisites

- Make sure you have Media Server instance [installed](ms-setup) and running.
- Make sure your Media Server instance is [accessible](ms-setup#testing-the-server).
- Make sure you have a compatible wallet with enough MEDIA to use the CDN service. MEDIA is currently available to buy in the following [markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/media-network#markets).


#### Add a new CDN Resource

#### Change your RTMP ingest URL and CDN URL 

After the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, a new random subdomain will be assigned to you. This is your new endpoint URL cached by Media Network.

Edit the config file of your Media Server adding this newly generated endpoint. You can also change your ingest RTMP server details here.

```bash
nano config.js
```

```js title="mediaserver/config.js"
const config = {
//...
  cdn_url: "https://Resource_ID.medianetwork.cloud",
  rtmp_url: "rtmp://YOUR.IP.ADDRESS",
//...
```

And then run the Media Server again to apply the changes:

```bash
node app.js
```

:::note
Congrats! Your Media Server instance is now powered and scaled by Media Network's dCDN. End-users accessing the new link will load the resources from their closest Media Edge node instead of your original server.
