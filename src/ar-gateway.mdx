title: Gateway Setup
---

In the following guide, we will cover all the necessary steps to set up an Arweave gateway.

### Requirements

1. A Unix OS (Debian 11 preferable)

2. Docker and Docker Compose LTS

### Suggested Hardware

There are several million transactions on the Arweave chain. In order to effectively serve content on the gateway you'll need a decent sized computer. The ideal specs for a Gateway should have the following:

1. 16GB RAM (ideally 32GB RAM)

2. ~4TB of SSD storage available

3. Intel i5 / AMD FX or greater, +4 vCPUs should be more than enough, these are typically Intel Xeon CPUs.

### Install Tools

```bash
sudo apt update; \
sudo apt -y install tmux curl nano apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-common
```

### Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

Import Docker GPG key used for signing Docker packages.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

### Add the Docker repository to Debian 10

Add Docker repository which contain the latest stable releases of Docker CE.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

### Install Docker

```bash
sudo apt update; \
sudo apt -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```
This installation will add docker group to the system without any users. Add your user account to the group to run docker commands as non-privileged user.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### Check docker and compose version

```bash
$ docker version
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           19.03.2
 API version:       1.40
 Go version:        go1.12.8

  ```

Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

```bash
exit
```
### Clone gateway repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mediafoundation/vartex
```
### Configure the gateway

First, let's copy the .env 

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
### Optionally add your own Arweave Node (miner)

```bash
nano .env
```

```bash
ARWEAVE_NODES=["https://arweave.net","http://gateway-4.arweave.net:1984","http://lon-6.eu-west-1.arweave.net:1984"]
PORT=3000
PARALLEL=32
POLLTIME_DELAY_SECONDS=5
DB_TIMEOUT=30
HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=15
CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS=["localhost:9042"]
KEYSPACE=gateway
CASSANDRA_USERNAME=cassandra
CASSANDRA_PASSWORD=cassandra
CACHE_IMPORT_PATH="cache/imports"
```


### Build and run Vartex 

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

:::tip
Make sure you build your docker image every time the .env file is modified in order to apply the new settings.
:::


While developing you can specify a range of blocks you wish to sync,
the range starts from the most recent known block from the cached hash_list
down X amount of blocks specified with DEVELOPMENT_SYNC_LENGTH.

```bash
# for cached block height 1,000,000 would only sync down to 999,900
DEVELOPMENT_SYNC_LENGTH=100
```

### Endpoints

You can test if the server and the GraphQL queries are working properly by navigating to.

```bash
http://localhost:3000/graphql
```

This webpage should look similar to.

```bash
https://arweave.net/graphql
```

### Local Testing

You can now access any content hosted on the Arweave network, for example the file we've just deployed `mytextfile.txt` using Arweave's txID:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/6KZ2ok0JV21mtzUdo5WT_ErcuoLk9-MZcPWLX5LPmK8
```

```bash
ARWEAVE TEST - VERSION 1
```

### Stopping the gateway

You can safely stop the gateway by running:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
