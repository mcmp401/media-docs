### Introduction to Smart Contracts
A smart contract is a self-executing digital contract that is stored on a blockchain network. It contains the terms of the agreement between parties, and it automatically executes when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, making them a transparent, secure, and efficient way of managing transactions and interactions.

### How Media Smart-Contracts Revolutionize the CDN Industry

Media Network is a decentralized marketplace for CDN services that utilizes smart-contracts to manage the interactions between CDN providers and clients. These smart-contracts are responsible for managing the transactions and interactions in the Media Network protocol.

In the traditional CDN industry, intermediaries such as middlemen, are often required to connect CDN providers to clients. However, with the use of smart-contracts, CDN providers can offer their services directly to clients without the need for intermediaries, creating a free market. This decentralization of the marketplace allows clients to easily hire and connect their resources to multiple CDN providers from a single interface, using MEDIA tokens for payments.

One of the key benefits of using smart-contracts is that they ensure that all interactions are transparent, secure, and fair. They also allow for the creation of resources and the exchange of MEDIA tokens as a payment method. Additionally, because the terms of the agreement are encoded on the blockchain, they are immutable and cannot be altered, ensuring that the terms of the agreement are respected.

The use of smart-contracts also allows for a "multi-CDN approach" in which clients can connect their resources to multiple providers simultaneously. This ensures that no single provider can censor their resources, and clients can switch providers at any time to maintain control. 

In summary, Media Network's use of smart-contracts revolutionizes the CDN industry by providing a decentralized, transparent, and secure marketplace for CDN services. It allows CDN providers to offer their services directly to clients, and clients to easily connect their resources to multiple providers, giving them more choices and the opportunity to find the best services for their needs.

### Dispute resolution

Additionally, the use of smart-contracts enables a dispute resolution mechanism, in case there is a disagreement between the parties. This allows for a democratic and decentralized way to handle issues, as disputes can be escalated to the Media Network Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for further review and resolution. The DAO is a self-governed entity controlled by the Media Network community, which uses MEDIA tokens to vote and determine the direction and development of the protocol.

In conclusion, the use of smart-contracts in the Media Network protocol revolutionizes the CDN industry by providing a more efficient, transparent, and secure marketplace for CDN services.
