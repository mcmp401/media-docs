With Storj DCS (Decentralized Cloud Storage) files aren’t stored in centralized data centers— instead, they're encrypted, split into pieces, and distributed on a global cloud network powered by the community.

### Secure
Every file is encrypted, split into pieces, and stored on diverse Nodes, making data breaches a thing of the past. This decentralized approach also protects your data from malicious attacks.

### Private
Default encryption is standard on every file. Everything is encrypted before being uploaded—your data is only in your hands and those you share it with.

### Available
Due to the decentralized network of Storage Nodes, your data is multi-region by default, always available when you need it and can scale with your project as it grows.

### S3 Compatible
Storj DCS works with the tools you already use and deploys in minutes with drop-in S3 compatibility.

### Works with your existing stack.
Storj DCS has a robust developer toolkit and a number of integrations to help you build the next groundbreaking application.

### Open Source
Storj is open source and always will be.
