Arweave is a software that seeks to store files permanently across a distributed network of computers. Its goal is to build something not unlike the fabled Library of Alexandria: a digital archive that persists in perpetuity. 
Arweave is a novel data storage blockchain protocol enabling a permanent serverless web - it uberizes the traditional web hosting environment, connecting people with spare hard drive space with people that need to store data.
It offers unparalleled levels of data replication and security for users, as well as financial incentives for participants in the network, all while cutting out the middleman. Arweave has set the new standard of highly reliable, lightning fast web application hosting at a fraction of the cost of traditional centralised providers: It’s the web you can own and run.

### Media Network + Arweave

Arweave integrates easily with Media Network. Arweave is an excellent protocol to index and host content (like NFTs, videos, or even websites) in a decentralized way. Still, it lacks a critical component: a way to deliver content to end-users fast and secure. A Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Media Network is needed to ultimately serve these files to end-users using a regular web browser. 
This section will show how to set-up and configure an Arweave Node (Miner), Arweave Gateway (Vartex) and then add them to Media Network's CDN.
