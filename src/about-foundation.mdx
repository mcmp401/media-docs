### About the team

The Media Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to the decentralization, growth, and security of Media Network. It is dedicated and committed towards building the infrastructure for a democratic and efficient dCDN. 

Our team comprises engineers, researchers, scientists, designers, and entrepreneurs who share the same vision, most of them coming from the Web2 CDN industry. We will remain completely anonymous until the project achieves complete decentralization. We believe this is the only way to create a genuinely censorship-resistant network and avoid any pressure from entities and governments trying to shut it down.
