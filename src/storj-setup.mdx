### Storj DCS S3 Gateway

It can be used as an origin for public and private Storj buckets via the Storj DCS S3 Gateway. 

:::note
Storj DCS is a decentralized object storage service that is S3 compatible and end-to-end encrypted by default.
:::

### Pre-requisites

- OS: Debian 11
- [Storj DCS account](https://www.storj.io/signup/)
- [Project and access credentials](https://docs.storj.io/dcs/getting-started/quickstart-uplink-cli/uploading-your-first-object/create-first-access-grant/)

### Install dependencies

```bash
apt install unzip
```

### Installing the Storj Gateway

Download, unzip, and install the binary

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/storj/gateway-st/releases/latest/download/gateway_linux_amd64.zip -O && unzip gateway_linux_amd64.zip; \
chmod 755 gateway; \
sudo mv gateway /usr/local/bin/gateway
```

### Interactive Setup

Setup your S3 gateway by running the following command and following the instructions provided by the wizard.
Enter the numeric choice or satellite address corresponding to the satellite you’ve created your account on.
The satellite address should be entered as `<nodeid>@<address>:<port>` for example: `12L9ZFwhzVpuEKMUNUqkaTLGzwY9G24tbiigLiXpmZWKwmcNDDs@eu1.storj.io:7777`, or just use the number from the list.

```bash
root@6255deca2f353900013ffbe1:~# gateway setup
Select your satellite:
	[1] us1.storj.io
	[2] eu1.storj.io
	[3] ap1.storj.io
Enter number or satellite address as "<nodeid>@<address>:<port>" [1]: 1
Enter your API key: 1dfJ8UityiNP47FV2Nu3FdEBF1vj8buzKM5X9L24Cudm4kpRzY45AfE5UTjmKQRaYzyYd1eRnXYykjUWgAEfTrrzpu77JXbBWEDgaKqwQfeBx1PH4jYn
Enter your encryption passphrase: 
Enter your encryption passphrase again: 

With your permission, Storj DCS can automatically collect anonymized analytics information from your S3 Gateway and send it to Storj Labs (makers of Storj DCS) to help improve the quality and performance of our products.
Do you agree to submit such information to Storj Labs (y/N): n

Your S3 Gateway is configured and ready to use!
```

### Editing the config 

You can see the path to the default config file config.yaml with this command:

```bash
gateway help
```

### Hosting a static website 

Make sure you make the following changes if you're planning to host a website. ```server.address``` exposes the local interface to the public internet.

```js title="~/.local/share/storj/gateway/config.yaml"
//...
# address to serve S3 api over
server.address: 0.0.0.0:7777
# serve content as a static website
website: true
//...
```

### Local Caching 

You can use the Minio caching technology in conjunction with the hosting of a static website.   
The following example uses /mnt/drive1, /mnt/drive2 ,/mnt/cache1 … /mnt/cache3 for caching, while excluding all objects under bucket mybucket and all objects with ‘.pdf’ extensions on a S3 Gateway setup. Objects are cached if they have been accessed three times or more. Cache max usage is restricted to 80% of disk capacity in this example. Garbage collection is triggered when the high watermark is reached (i.e. at 72% of cache disk usage) and will clear the least recently accessed entries until the disk usage drops to the low watermark - i.e. cache disk usage drops to 56% (70% of 80% quota).

Export the environment variables before running the Gateway:

```bash
export MINIO_CACHE="on"
export MINIO_CACHE_DRIVES="/mnt/drive1,/mnt/drive2,/mnt/cache{1...3}"
export MINIO_CACHE_EXCLUDE="*.pdf,mybucket/*"
export MINIO_CACHE_QUOTA=80
export MINIO_CACHE_AFTER=3
export MINIO_CACHE_WATERMARK_LOW=70
export MINIO_CACHE_WATERMARK_HIGH=90
```

:::warning
Setting `MINIO_BROWSER=off` env variable would disable the Minio browser capabilites. This would make sense if running the gateway as a static website or as CDN origin in production.
:::

### Running the Gateway 

```bash
root@NLDW4-3-42-40:~# gateway run
2022-04-04T06:21:34.903+0200	INFO	Configuration loaded	{"Location": "/root/.local/share/storj/gateway/config.yaml"}

### Create a bucket & upload a file

To test this we'll just drop an `index.html` text-only file using drag & drop

### Testing your gateway 

Before adding it to Media's dCDN, we're going to make sure the gateway is working by trying to reach the previously uploaded file/website with curl or a web browser:

```bash
root@6255deca2f353900013ffbe1:~# curl -v http://localhost:7777/demo-bucket/index.html
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:7777...
