### Add your Arweave gateway to Media Network

### Pre-requisites

- Make sure you have vartex [installed](ar-gateway).
- Make sure your gateway is [accessible](ar-gateway#local-testing).
- Make sure you have a compatible wallet with enough MEDIA to use the CDN service. MEDIA is currently available to buy in the following [markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/media-network#markets).

### Step 1 - Find out Arweave's gateway port and IP address:

In this step you'll have to find out the details about your Arweave gateway to be able to add it later on to Media Network.
You can check what is running in each port by exectuing the following command:

```bash
netstat -ntpl
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5001          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14732/ipfs          
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8080            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14732/ipfs          
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1014/sshd           
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      19072/docker-proxy  
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5432            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      18884/docker-proxy  
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4001            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14732/ipfs          
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1014/sshd           
tcp6       0      0 :::3000                 :::*                    LISTEN      19079/docker-proxy  
tcp6       0      0 :::5432                 :::*                    LISTEN      18892/docker-proxy
tcp6       0      0 :::4001                 :::*                    LISTEN      14732/ipfs 
```

In this case we can check that the docker container running the gateway is running on port ***3000*** under PID ***19079***

Now let's check the external IP address of your device:

```bash
ifconfig
eno1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 141.120.114.66  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 141.120.114.66
        inet6 fe80::2eea:7fff:fef0:f2fe  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 2c:ea:7f:f0:f2:fe  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 9245489  bytes 1915123059 (1.7 GiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 34  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 4943558  bytes 970078005 (925.1 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
        device interrupt 49  

```

In this case, we can check that the external IP address is ***141.120.114.66*** using the ***eno1*** interface.

This means your Arweave gateway is running at the following URL, which is what you'll need to add as a CDN resource:

```bash
http://141.120.114.66:3000
```

### Step 2 - Add your resource to the network

Access the [Media App](https://app.media.network), connect your wallet and add a new CDN resource. Specify IP, port and approve the transaction.

### Finalizing the process

After the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, a new random subdomain will be assigned to you. This is your new endpoint URL cached by Media Network.

Congrats! Your Arweave gateway is now powered and scaled by Media Network's dCDN. End-users accessing the new link will load the resources from their closest Media Edge node instead of your original server.

:::note
You can now serve any content hosted on the Arweave network to your end-users, through your **own** Arweave Miner/Gateway combination via Media's dCDN.
