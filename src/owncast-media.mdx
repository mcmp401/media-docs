#### Add your Owncast instance to Media Network

To scale your Owncast server and make it available to huge audiences through a community-powered CDN, you can register it as a resource on Media Network using the Media App front-end.

We're assuming you've already have your SPL wallet loaded with some SOL to pay for transactions fees, and at least the equivalent of 25 MEDIA (LP Tokens from Raydium's MEDIA-USDC pool count towards this) in order to use the CDN service.

#### Add your CDN resource

Access the [Media App](https://app.media.network) and connect your SPL wallet.

#### Specify IP, port and approve the transaction

***If everything went smoothly and the transaction was approved and confirmed, you'll see your resource ID and which origin it points to.***

Congrats! Your Owncast instance is now powered and scaled by Media Network. End-users accessing the new link will load the resources from Media Edges around the world instead of your original server, offloading bandwidth!

You can now access your stream through your **own** streaming platform and delivered by Media Network:
