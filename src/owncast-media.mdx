#### Add your Owncast instance to Media Network

To scale your Owncast server and make it available to huge audiences through a community-powered CDN, you can register it as a resource on Media Network using the Media App front-end.

We're assuming you've already have your wallet loaded to pay for transactions fees, and the required amount of MEDIA in order to use the CDN service.

### Pre-requisites

- Make sure you have [owncast installed](owncast-setup).
- Make sure you have a compatible wallet with enough MEDIA to use the CDN service. MEDIA is currently available to buy in the following [markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/media-network#markets).

#### Find out Owncast's port:

In this step you'll have to find out the details about your Owncast instance. You can check what is running in each port by executing the following command:


```bash
root@owncast:~# netstat -ntpl
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:33257         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1292/./owncast      
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      600/sshd            
tcp6       0      0 :::1935                 :::*                    LISTEN      1292/./owncast      
tcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      1292/./owncast      
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      600/sshd  
```

Owncast is running on port ***8080*** for HTTP and ***1935*** for incoming RTMP streams, both under PID ***1292***

#### Find out external IP address of your device:

```bash
root@owncast:~# ifconfig
eno1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 141.120.114.66  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 141.120.114.66
        inet6 fe80::2eea:7fff:fef0:f2fe  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 2c:ea:7f:f0:f2:fe  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 9245489  bytes 1915123059 (1.7 GiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 34  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 4943558  bytes 970078005 (925.1 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
        device interrupt 49  

```

The external IP address is ***141.120.114.66*** using the ***eno1*** interface.

This means your Owncast instance is running at the following URL, which is what we'll need to add as a CDN resource:

```bash
http://141.120.114.66:8080
```

### Adding your Owncast instance to Media Network

Access the [Media App](https://app.media.network), connect your wallet and add a new CDN resource. Specify IP, port and approve the transaction.

### Finalizing the process

Congrats! Your Owncast instance is now powered and scaled by Media Network's dCDN. End-users accessing the new link will load the resources from their closest Media Edge node instead of your original server.
