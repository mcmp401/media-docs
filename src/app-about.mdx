Media App is a front-end created by the Media Foundation to interact with Solanaâ€™s Blockchain, Serum AMM's, and to participate in the distributed economy. It is compatible with any SPL (Solana Program Library) wallet and enables developers to set up and configure resources on the network, like new origins or allowed domains to use the Media PeerPool library.

Media App front-end shows all limits and quotas available per resource automatically based on wallet weight.
