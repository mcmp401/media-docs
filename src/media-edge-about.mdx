Media Edge is a new and powerful software that allows CDN providers to create their content delivery network and sell their services in the decentralized Media Network marketplace. With the Media Edge, providers can easily set up their CDN networks, offer them within the Media Network marketplace, and get MEDIA rewards in exchange for the services provided. 

## What is Media Edge?

Media Edge is an open-source software that serves as a web server and blockchain resource manager for CDN providers. It is a tool that simplifies the process of setting up a CDN network, and it includes all the necessary features to interact with the Media Network smart contracts.

## Media Edge and Media Guard

Media Edge and Media Guard were previously two different software programs that operated separately. However, they are now merging into one software called Media Edge. This new software is optional, meaning that providers do not have to use it if they donâ€™t want to; providers can select their software (for example, nginx instead of Caddy) as long as it meets the requirements of the Media Network smart contracts. 

## Future of Media Edge

With the all-new Media Edge launching in 2023 and the autonomous nature of the protocol make for a promising future for Media Network. The Media Edge software is a powerful tool that will allow CDN providers to easily set up their networks and join the decentralized marketplace, creating a more competitive and diverse ecosystem for CDN services.

## Conclusion

The Media Edge is a key component of the Media Network protocol that simplifies the process of setting up a CDN network and allows providers to join the decentralized marketplace. With the Media Edge, providers can easily set up their CDN networks, offer them within the Media Network marketplace, and get MEDIA rewards in exchange for the services provided. This new software allows for a more competitive and diverse ecosystem for CDN services, fostering innovation and driving the growth of the Media Network protocol.
