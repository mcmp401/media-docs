## About the team

The Media Foundation is dedicated and committed towards building the infrastructure for a democratic and efficient content delivery network. Our team comprises engineers, researchers, scientists, designers, and entrepreneurs who share the same vision. We will remain completely anonymous until the project achieves complete decentralization. We believe this is the only way to create a genuinely censorship-resistant network and avoid any pressure from entities and governments trying to shut it down.
