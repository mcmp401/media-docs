### Media Smart-Contracts 

Media Smart-contracts are digital agreements encoded on the blockchain that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. They are responsible for managing the transactions and interactions between CDN providers and clients in the Media Network protocol. Media Smart-contracts ensure that all interactions are transparent, secure and fair. They also allow for the creation of resources and the exchange of MEDIA tokens as a payment method.

### Media Edge

Media Edge is an open-source software that serves as a web server and blockchain resource manager for CDN providers. It is the software that providers can use to easily set up their CDN networks, offer them within the Media Network marketplace, and get MEDIA rewards in exchange for the services provided. With Media Edge, providers can manage their CDN networks more efficiently and effectively.

### Media App 

Media App is the front-end interface that allows users to interact with the Media Network protocol. It is designed to make it easy for users to access the decentralized marketplace and connect with CDN providers. It is important to note that Media App is not the only way to interact with the protocol, and anyone can create their own front-end interface to interact with the Media Smart-contracts.
