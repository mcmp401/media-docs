### Media Network smart contracts 

Media smart contracts are digital agreements encoded on the blockchain that automatically execute when certain conditions are met.  They manage the transactions and interactions between CDN providers and clients in the Media Network protocol to ensure that all interactions are transparent, secure, and fair. They also allow for the creation of resources and exchanging MEDIA tokens as a payment method.

### Media Edge

Media Edge is open-source software that makes it easy for CDN providers to set up and manage their networks. By using Media Edge, providers can offer their servers on the Media Network marketplace and earn $MEDIA rewards. This optional software helps providers run their CDN networks more efficiently and effectively.

### Media App 

The Media App is the front-end interface that allows users to interact with the Media Network protocol. It is designed to make it easy for users to access the decentralized marketplace and connect with CDN providers. It is important to note that Media App is one of many ways to interact with the protocol, as anyone can create their own front-end interface to interact with the protocol smart contracts.
