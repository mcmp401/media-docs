## Adding files to the Arweave network

You can add any type of content to Arweave. In this case we will put some text content into a `.txt` file called `mytextfile.txt` and put the text _"ARWEAVE TEST - VERSION 1"_ in it. Make sure you first install [`arweave-deploy`](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-deploy) and load your Arweave wallet with AR tokens to be able to add files to the Arweave Network. You can buy AR in the following [markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arweave#markets). In this specific case, the price to deploy a txt file was ***0.000001824540 AR***
```bash
echo "ARWEAVE TEST - VERSION 1" > mytextfile.txt
```
You can read the file's contents using the cat command:

```bash
cat mytextfile.txt
```

```bash
ARWEAVE TEST - VERSION 1
```
Upload mytextfile.txt to Arweave:

```bash
arweave deploy mytextfile.txt
```

```bash
