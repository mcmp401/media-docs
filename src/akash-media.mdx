To scale up your akash vm instance to million of users and make it available through a truly powerful and decentralized CDN, you can register it as a new CDN resource. This can be done through the [Media App](https://app.media.network), a front-end developed by the Media Foundation to interact with Media Network enabling developers to set up and configure CDN resources.

### Pre-requisites

- Make sure you have Akash VM instance is running your application application running [installed](akash-setup).
- Make sure your Akash VM instance is [accessible](akash-setup#testing-the-instance).
- Make sure you have a compatible wallet with enough MEDIA to use the CDN service. MEDIA is currently available to buy in the following [markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/media-network#markets).

#### Change your RTMP ingest URL and CDN URL 

After the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, a new random subdomain will be assigned to you. This is your new endpoint URL cached by Media Network.

Edit the config file of your Media Server adding this newly generated endpoint. You can also change your ingest RTMP server details here.


:::note
Congrats! Your origin is now powered and scaled by Media Network's dCDN. End-users accessing the new link will load the resources from their closest Media Edge node instead of your original server.
