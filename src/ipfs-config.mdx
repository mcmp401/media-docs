### Optimize OS
```bash
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2500000
```

### Make your gateway public

By default, your IPFS HTTP gateway is not exposed to the world. It only works locally. Let's allow anyone in with this command to enable it on port 8080:

```bash
sudo ipfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8080
```

:::note
You'll need to restart the IPFS daemon with `sudo ipfs daemon` in order to changes to apply.

### Accessing your HTTP Gateway

Check with curl command if IPFS HTTP gateway is accessible by trying to download a file from the IPFS network.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmS7S76K81Qq5AeHFN5tPL8uDhY3NCCSSSBAD4xaMAq87m
```
If everything works smoothly, you should get the content of that file:

```bash
IPFS TEST - VERSION 1
```

Congrats! If your gateway is reachable, we're now ready to upload files to the network.
