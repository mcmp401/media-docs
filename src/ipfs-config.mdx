### Optimize OS
```bash
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2500000
```

### Make your gateway public

By default, your IPFS HTTP gateway is not exposed to the world. It only works locally. Let's allow anyone in with this command to enable it on port 8080:

```bash
sudo ipfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8080
```
Please restart the IPFS daemon in order to changes to apply.

### Accessing your HTTP Gateway

Check with curl command if IPFS HTTP gateway is accessible by trying to download the previously added [`mytextfile.txt`](ipfs-setup#adding-files-to-ipfs)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmS7S76K81Qq5AeHFN5tPL8uDhY3NCCSSSBAD4xaMAq87m
```
If everything works smoothly, you should get this:

```bash
IPFS TEST - VERSION 1
```

Congrats! If your gateway is reachable, we're now ready to add it to Media Network.
