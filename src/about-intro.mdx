### What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers located in multiple data centers around the world, designed to deliver content such as web pages, images, videos, and other digital assets to users as fast as possible. The main goal of a CDN is to reduce latency and improve the availability of content to users by bringing the data closer to them.

### How does a CDN work?
A CDN works by caching files (objects) and serving them directly instead of going to the origin server for every request. Because a CDN considers the visitorâ€™s geolocation, the files are served by the closest server to the user to reduce latency.

### What is Media Network?

Media Network is a decentralized, blockchain-based Content Delivery Network (CDN) marketplace. The protocol allows individuals and businesses to buy and sell CDN services directly, without intermediaries or middlemen, creating a free market.

### A secure, transparent, and blockchain-agnostic CDN Marketplace.
The use of smart contracts and MEDIA tokens for payments, allows clients to hire and connect their resources to multiple CDN providers from a single interface, ensuring that no single provider can censor their resources, and clients can switch providers at any time to maintain control. The Multi-CDN approach also boosts speed and performance when using multiple providers simultaneously. The use of blockchain technology ensures that the marketplace is decentralized, censorship-resistant, and secure, while also providing a transparent and immutable marketplace, ensuring fair and trustworthy interactions.
