Media Network is a new protocol that foregoes traditional centralized CDN approaches and opts for a self-governed, open-source solution. We’ve created a distributed bandwidth market that enables service providers to hire resources from the network which are variable, as the demand for last-mile data delivery fluctuates.

Any existing infrastructure can now be scaled by hiring bandwidth-on-demand without constraining long-term business commitments or compromising privacy. No accounts, KYC, or personal information is required at any point for any of the participants of the network.

### PaaS (Protocol as a Service)

With Media Network, any DAO or Anon DeFi Team can serve their content using the power of a decentralized protocol, without doxing a team member or with a single point of failure as it happens with Web2 Legacy CDN providers controlled by an entity. Protocols, not companies.

### Web3 Composability

With multiple integrations, Media Network’s dCDN is a perfect combination with any existing storage protocols such as Arweave, IPFS, or BTFS. It’s also already integrated with Handshake for decentralized domains names. Combining the power of decentralized protocols, anyone can start right now and build with the perfect Web3 stack: 

Handshake (HNS) as a decentralized DNS, compatible with legacy systems.
Arweave (AR) as a decentralized storage protocol to store apps or websites.
Media Network (MEDIA) as a decentralized CDN delivering content to end-users.


### How It Works

Media Network creates a distributed bandwidth market that enables service providers such as media platforms to hire resources from the network and dynamically come and go as the demand for last-mile data delivery shifts. It allows anyone to organically set up new Media Edges and serve content without introducing trust assumptions or pre-authentication requirements. These participants earn MEDIA rewards for their bandwidth contributions, a fixed supply SPL token minted on Solana’s Blockchain. The protocol utilizes new mechanisms to encourage honest and collaborative work between participants of the network.

### CDN Service

To scale an existing infrastructure, developers or media platforms will have to buy MEDIA off exchanges, provide liquidity to designated pools, and stake the resulting LP MEDIA tokens. After that, they will have to authenticate with a compatible wallet to any of the available front-ends (e.g., [Media App](app-about)) and set up their resources and custom settings. 

Once the transactions are confirmed, Media Guards will verify the amount of staked LP MEDIA tokens and, if conditions are met, authorize the new resource into the network assigning bandwidth quotas, DNS names, and security settings. Everything is encrypted with a password and recorded on the blockchain.

### Fees

Data transfer fees are deducted automatically from the stake, depending on consumption and the community’s current fee pricing. Bandwidth quota depends on the amount of LP tokens staked; the more MEDIA staked, the more burstable bandwidth available for a specific resource’s end-users. As the stake gets reduced by the data consumption, so is the bandwidth available for that specific resource.

### 100% Blockchain Based

Media Edges listening to these on-chain transactions will then start pulling the content from the origin and replicating it worldwide, relaying the data on-demand. End users requesting the new provided URL instead of the original path to the source will get the data from the closest edge based on geolocation and latency, optimizing last-mile delivery.
Now anyone can quickly scale heavy multimedia-dependent applications or websites and hold millions of requests simultaneously without the need to be an engineer or compromising privacy at any point.
