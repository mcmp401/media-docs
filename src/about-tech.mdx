### How It Works

Anyone can set up new Media Edges and serve content without introducing trust assumptions or pre-authentication requirements. These participants earn MEDIA rewards for their bandwidth contributions. The protocol utilizes new mechanisms to encourage honest and collaborative work between network participants.

### CDN Service

To use the service, developers or media platforms will have to buy MEDIA off exchanges, provide liquidity to designated pools, and stake the resulting LP MEDIA tokens. After that, they will have to authenticate with a compatible wallet to any of the available front-ends (e.g., [Media App](https://app.media.network)) and set up their resources and custom settings. 

Once the transactions are confirmed, Media Guards will verify the amount of staked LP MEDIA tokens and, if conditions are met, register the new resource into the network assigning bandwidth quotas, DNS names, and security settings. Everything is encrypted with a password and recorded on the blockchain.

### 100% Blockchain Based

Media Edges listening to these on-chain transactions will then start pulling the content from the origin and replicating it worldwide, relaying the data on-demand. End users requesting the new provided URL instead of the original path to the source will get the data from the closest edge based on geolocation and latency, optimizing last-mile delivery.
Now anyone can quickly scale heavy multimedia-dependent applications or websites and hold millions of requests simultaneously without the need to be an engineer or compromise privacy at any point.

### Network Fees

To use the dCDN service, staking LP MEDIA is required. Fees are deducted automatically from the stake. Bandwidth quota depends on the amount of LP tokens staked; the more MEDIA staked, the more burstable bandwidth available for a specific resource. As the stake gets reduced by the data consumption, so is the burstable bandwidth available for that particular resource.
