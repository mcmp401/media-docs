Media Server is an open-source software that allows you to transcode, broadcast, and serve live video and audio streams. Currently, Media Server supports RTMP as input format and HLS as output format. [Media PeerPool](peerpool-about) is integrated by default, meaning that you can also benefit from its peer-to-peer capabilities out of the box.

### Deploy your own streaming platform in minutes
Media Server allows anybody with a VPS or dedicated server to start a streaming platform. But what if you wanted to scale and serve video to millions of users? Your VPS wouldn't be enough to deliver the thousands of gigabytes of data per second required to do so. That's where Media Network comes into play.

Setting up a Media Server instance and adding it to Mediaâ€™s CDN through a front-end like the [Media App](https://app.media.network) will allow Media Edges to pull the content from your origin server and make it available to your end-users. By using Media Network as your CDN, you'll be able to hold millions of viewers without stressing your infrastructure and without exposing your original server IP address, eliminating the risk of a direct DDoS attack.

### Hosted Version: Media Server Express
If you'd like to stream or test the network but can't install a Media Server instance, feel free to try our hosted <a href="https://mediaserver.express" target="_blank">Media Server</a> powered by Media Network.
