### Create a Livestream

Livepeer supports livestreaming using the RTMP protocol, which is supported by
most broadcast software/hardware as well as open source software for mobile
applications.

For this guide, we recommend [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download). Once you
have it downloaded and installed follow these steps to start livestreaming:

1. Navigate to Settings -> Stream
2. Enter the RTMP Server URL provided by your broadcaster node. If you're running a VPS please use its public IPv4 address. You'll also need to add a stream key such as `stream`

3. Make sure to set the `Keyframe Interval` to `2` as seen in the screenshot below. Otherwise the broadcaster node will fail to transcode the stream.

### Playback 

To check if your broadcaster node is working correctly, we'll go ahead and test your livestream, using the playback url that was created for you by
your broadcaster node.

`http://hostname:8935/stream/stream.m3u8`

Congrats! If the stream plays correctly, it means you've succesfully configured your Livepeer broadcaster node and that your video is being transcoded by the Livepeer protocol.
