To scale up your IPFS gateway to million of users and make it available through a community-powered CDN, you can register your IPFS gateway as a resource on Media Network using the Media App front-end in 2 easy steps.

We're assuming you've already have your SPL wallet loaded with some SOL to pay for transactions fees, and at least the equivalent of 25 MEDIA (LP Tokens from Raydium's MEDIA-USDC pool count towards this) in order to use the CDN service.

### Step 1 - Find out IPFS gateway port and IP address:

In this step you'll have to find out the details about your IPFS gateway to be able to add it later on to Media Network.
You can check what is running in each port by exectuing the following command:

```bash
netstat -ntpl
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5001          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14732/ipfs          
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8080            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14732/ipfs          
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1014/sshd           
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      19072/docker-proxy  
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5432            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      18884/docker-proxy  
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4001            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      14732/ipfs          
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1014/sshd           
tcp6       0      0 :::3000                 :::*                    LISTEN      19079/docker-proxy  
tcp6       0      0 :::5432                 :::*                    LISTEN      18892/docker-proxy
tcp6       0      0 :::4001                 :::*                    LISTEN      14732/ipfs 
```


In this case we can check that the IPFS HTTP gateway is running on port ***8080*** under PID ***14732***

Now let's check the external IP address of your device:

```bash
ifconfig
eno1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 141.120.114.66  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 141.120.114.66
        inet6 fe80::2eea:7fff:fef0:f2fe  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 2c:ea:7f:f0:f2:fe  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 9245489  bytes 1915123059 (1.7 GiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 34  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 4943558  bytes 970078005 (925.1 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
        device interrupt 49  
```
In this case, we can check that the external IP address is ***141.120.114.66*** using the ***eno1*** interface.

This means your IPFS gateway is running at the following URL, which is what you'll need to add as a CDN resource:

```bash
http://141.120.114.66:8080
```

### Step 2 - Add your resource to the network

Access the [Media App](https://app.media.network) and connect your SPL wallet.

Add your resource, specifying port number & and approve the transaction.

For example in this case:

```bash
http://141.120.114.66:8080
```
Please have in mind this IP is the local IP for the computer / server running the IPFS node. Please change it accordingly.

### Finalizing the process

If everything went smoothly and the transaction was approved and confirmed, you'll see your resource ID and which origin it points to. Congrats! Your local IPFS node is now powered and scaled by Media Network. End-users accessing the new link will load the resources from Media Edges around the world instead of your original HTTP gateway.

:::note
You can now serve any content hosted on IPFS to your end-users, through your **own** IPFS Gateway via Media's dCDN.
